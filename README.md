# 📝 Markov Chain Text Generator

This project implements a **simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains**.  
It learns from input text and generates **new text sequences** based on statistical word relationships.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Uses Markov Chains** to predict the next word based on previous words.
- **Trains on input text** and learns word sequences.
- **Generates new text dynamically** based on a seed phrase.
- **Optimized for simplicity & efficiency**.

## 🎯 Running the Text Generator

To train the Markov model and generate text, **run the script**:
```sh
python main.py
```

### **Example Usage**
```
Generated Text:
 The sky is blue, and the grass is green. The sun rises in the east and sets in
```
- The **text is generated based on a given seed phrase**.
